# BaseEx

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJs?color=009911&style=for-the-badge)](./LICENSE)


**BaseEx** is a collection of classes for data representation from Base16 (hex) to BasE91.
BaseEx is completely standalone and works client and serverside, with all these common representations in one place.
There are other good solutions for e.g. Base32, Base64, Base85, but BaseEx has them all in one place.
The **Ex** in the name stands for **Ex**ponent (of n) or - as read out loud - for an **X**.


### Available converters:
* ``Base16``
* ``Base32 (RFC 3548 and RFC 4648``
* ``Base64 (standard and urlsafe``
* ``Base85 (adobe/ascii85 and z85)``
* ``Base91``



## Installation

### Github
```sh
git clone https://github.com/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJS.git
```

### npm
```sh
nmp install base-ex
```

## Usage

### Importing

#### Browser

```html
<!-- the classic -->
<script src="path/BaseEx.min.js"></script>
```

```js
// ESM6 module
// main class
import {BaseEx} from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"

// explicit converter (e.g. Base32)
import {Base32} from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"
```

#### Node
```js
// main class
import {BaseEx} from "base-ex"

// explicit converter (e.g. Base32)
import {Base32} from "base-ex"
```

### Working with it (Browser/Node)
Try out the [Demopage](https://umamiappearance.github.io/BaseExJS/demo.html). You'll find an online base converter and code examples that will work independently from your environment (assuming the used class is imported).
