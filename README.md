**BaseEx** is a collection of classes for data representation from Base16 (hex) to basE91.
BaseEx is completely standalone and works client and server side.
There are other good solutions for e.g. Base32, Base64, Base85, but BaseEx has them all in one place.
The **Ex** in the name stands for **Ex**ponent (of n) or - as read out loud - for an **X**.


### Available converters:
* ``Base1/Unary``
* ``Base16``
* ``Base32 (RFC 3548 and RFC 4648)``
* ``Base58``
* ``Base64 (standard and urlsafe)``
* ``Base85 (adobe/ascii85 and z85)``
* ``Base91``
* ``LEB128``
* ``SimpleBase (2-36)``
* ``ByteConverter``


## Installation

### GitHub
```console
git clone https://github.com/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJS.git
```

### npm
```console
nmp install base-ex
```

## Builds
The GitHub repository has ready to use builds included. The npm package comes without pre build files. 

For building you have to run:

```console
npm install
npm run build
``` 

There are multiple builds available which are always grouped as [esm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [iife](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), plus a minified version of each. The full build with all converters included can be found at [dist](https://github.com/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJS/tree/main/dist), which contains:
* ``BaseEx.esm.js``
* ``BaseEx.esm.min.js``
* ``BaseEx.iife.js``
* ``BaseEx.iife.min.js``

Apart from the full build, every converter can be used standalone. The associated builds can be found at [dist/converters](https://github.com/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJS/tree/main/dist/converters). _Note that standalone converters are exported as default._


## Usage

### Importing

#### Browser

```html
<!-- the classic -->
<script src="path/BaseEx.iife.min.js"></script>
```

```js
// ESM6 module

// main class
import { BaseEx } from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"

// explicit converter (e.g. Base32)
import { Base32 } from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"

// explicit converter from a standalone build
import Base32 from "./path/base-32.esm.min.js"
```

#### Node
```js
// ESM6 Module

// main class
import { BaseEx } from "base-ex"

// explicit converter (e.g. Base64)
import { Base64 } from "base-ex"

// CommonJS
const BaseEx = require("base-ex"); 
```

#### Available imports Browser/Node
The **classic import** via script tag has them all available without further ado. As it is a [iife](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), everything is available under the scope of ``BaseEx``. 

* ``BaseEx.Base1``  
* ``BaseEx.Base16``
* ``BaseEx.Base32``
* ...
* ``BaseEx.BaseEx``
  
_(Which is not true for standalone builds, which are directly accessible, eg: ``Base16``, ``Base32``, ...)_
  
The same goes for the **CommonJS import** from Node. The only difference is, that the scope is not necessarily named ``BaseEx``, as this is defined by the user (``const myName = require("base-ex") --> myName.Base16...``).

Full **import** for **ES6** modules: 

```js
// browser
import {
    Base1,
    Base16,
    Base32,
    Base58,
    Base64,
    Base85,
    Base91,
    LEB128,
    SimpleBase,
    ByteConverter,
    BaseEx 
} from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"

// node
import { ... } from "base-ex"
```

### Creating an instance
Regardless of the environment, at instance of a converter gets created like so:
```
const b32 = new Base32();
```

The constructor takes some arguments/options (which may differ between different encoder types). Those can also can be passed ephemeral to the encoder and/or decoder.
