**BaseEx** is a collection of classes for data representation from Base16 (hex) to basE91.
BaseEx is completely standalone and works client and server side.
There are other good solutions for e.g. Base32, Base64, Base85, but BaseEx has them all in one place.
The **Ex** in the name stands for **Ex**ponent (of n) or - as read out loud - for an **X**.


### Available converters:
* ``Base16``
* ``Base32 (RFC 3548 and RFC 4648)``
* ``Base64 (standard and urlsafe)``
* ``Base85 (adobe/ascii85 and z85)``
* ``Base91``


## Installation

### GitHub
```sh
git clone https://github.com/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJS.git
```

### npm
```sh
nmp install base-ex
```

## Builds
The GitHub repository has ready to use builds included. You can find them in [dist](https://github.com/UmamiAppearance/BaseExJS/tree/main/dist). The npm package comes without pre build files. 

For building you have to run:

```sh
npm run build
``` 

Either way you have two builds available ([esm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [iife](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)), plus a minified version of each. 
* ``BaseEx.esm.js``
* ``BaseEx.esm.min.js``
* ``BaseEx.iife.js``
* ``BaseEx.iife.min.js``

If you need to use BaseEx in your browser with a classic script tag, use a ``iife`` version. For modular usage ``esm``.


## Usage

### Importing

#### Browser

```html
<!-- the classic -->
<script src="path/BaseEx.iife.min.js"></script>
```

```js
// ESM6 module

// main class
import {BaseEx} from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"

// explicit converter (e.g. Base32)
import {Base32} from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"
```

#### Node
```js
// ESM6 Module

// main class
import {BaseEx} from "base-ex"

// explicit converter (e.g. Base64)
import {Base64} from "base-ex"

// CommonJS
const BaseEx = require("base-ex"); 
```

#### Available imports Browser/Node
The **classic import** via script tag has them all available without further ado. As it is a [iife](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), everything is available under the scope of ``BaseEx``.

* ``BaseEx.Base16``
* ``BaseEx.Base32``
* ...
* ``BaseEx.BaseEx``

The same goes for the **CommonJS import** from Node. The only difference is, that the scope is not necessarily named ``BaseEx``, as this is defined by the user (``const myName = require("base-ex") --> myName.Base16...``).

Full **import** for **ES6** modules: 

```js
// browser
import {Base16, Base32, Base64, Base85, Base91, BaseEx} from "./path/BaseEx.esm.min.js"

// node
import {Base16, Base32, Base64, Base85, Base91, BaseEx} from "base-ex"
```

### Working with it (Browser/Node)
